        <p>Miagao Church along Zulueta Avenue in Miagao is probably the most visually appealing, age-old church in the province of Iloilo. Also known as the Church of Saint Thomas of Villanova, its construction was completed in 1797. <br><br>

            Today, it is one of the most unique Iloilo tourist spots and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed as one of the top examples of a Baroque-style church. <br><br>
            
            It is also famous for the detailed, artistic sculptures that adorn its facade, showcasing a unique mix of Spanish, Muslim, and Chinese traditions, influence, and elements. <br><br>
            
            The image of the town's patron saint, St. Thomas of Villanueva, can be seen above its ornate wooden doors. <br><br>
            
            Getting to Miagao Church is pretty straightforward. Take a jeepney bound for Miagao from Iloilo City. The church is about 45 minutes away from the city proper. <br><br>
            
            You can also join a guided tour that will bring you to this destination, among many other day trips in Miagao Church.</p>
