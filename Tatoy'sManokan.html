            One of Iloilo's best restaurants is Tatoy's Manokan. This popular restaurant was founded in the 1970s and was originally a three table nipa shack. 
            Tatoy was a fisherman, but he had the skills to cook them into tasty dishes. <br><br>

            Tatoy's is best known for their lechon manok (roasted chicken). Tatoy's chicken is marinated in native vinegar and calamansi with stuffed tamarind leaves and lemongrass.
            It has a rich, juicy, and savoy flavor that needs no sauce. <br><br>

            Tatoy's also offer a wide variety of delicious seafood dishes. 
            They have fresh scallops cooked with butter and garlic, grilled fish, kinilaw (ceviche), and stuffed squid. <br><br>

            There's a large glass-covered table where a selection of mouthwatering meals are presented. They provide fresh mango, coconut shake, and coconut juice.
