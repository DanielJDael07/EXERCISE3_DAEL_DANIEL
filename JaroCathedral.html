            <h1>Jaro Cathedral</h1>
            <img src="JaroCathedraljpg.jpg" alt="" width="640px">
            <p>The Jaro Cathedral is one of Iloilo's oldest churches with a long, colorful history. Also known as the Church of St. Elizabeth of Hungary and National Shrine of Our Lady of the Candles, locals lovingly call it merely as Jaro Cathedral. <br><br>

            It first started as a small parish back in 1587. As the years went by, it became a cathedral, and today, it is a national shrine that serves as the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Jaro. <br><br>

            The church was destroyed by an earthquake back in 1948 and was rebuilt in 1956. In 1976, the Jaro Cathedral was declared a historical landmark. <br><br>

            Interestingly, the Jaro Cathedral is called the ‚Äúmale church,‚Äù while the Molo Church, which is also in Iloilo, is called the ‚Äúfemale church.‚Äù The churches got their nicknames because of the saints displayed there. <br><br>
            </p>

            <p>Jaro Cathedral has male saints standing inside the church pillars while Molo Church features female saints. Many people, especially locals, believe that the church's 400-year-old image of Mother and Child is miraculous. <br><br>

                You can find the Jaro Cathedral along the busy Plaza Rizal Street in Jaro. The best time to visit this during your day trip in Iloilo is early in the morning or just before evening as the town winds down. <br><br>
                
                While you‚Äôre there, do check out the nearby bell tower called the Campanario de Jaro, which is another famous Iloilo landmark.</p>
