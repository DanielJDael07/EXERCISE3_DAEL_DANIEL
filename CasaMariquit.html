        <p>
            Casa Mariquit is a must-see well-preserved historic house in Iloilo. The house has been passed down through generations. 

            It became the residence of Mariquit Javellana Lopez, the granddaughter of banker Ram√≥n Javellana, and her husband Fernando Lopez Sr., the former Vice President of the Philippines. <br><br>

            The word ‚Äúmariquit‚Äù comes from the Tagalog word marikit which means beautiful, most likely referring to both the lady of the house and the house itself. <br><br>

            A Casa Mariquit excursion will take you around the property: the master bedroom, the former bank vault that Ramon Javellana used during his banker days, and the many furniture and memorabilia that belongs to the family spanning generations. <br><br>

            Unlike other ancestral homes in Iloilo, Casa Mariquit doesn't have sprawling lawns. It's also not as grand as it looks. But the furniture and political campaign paraphernalia here speak volumes about its history.<br><br>
