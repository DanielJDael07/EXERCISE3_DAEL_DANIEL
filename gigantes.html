      <p>
        Your trip to Iloilo won‚Äôt be complete without trying different
        adventures in Gigantes Islands. Also called Islas de Gigantes, it is
        perhaps the most famous Iloilo tourist spot with its secret caves and
        lagoons, fantastic beaches, and gastronomic seafood lunch buffets!
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are the top activities you should add to your Islas de Gigantes
        island hopping itinerary:
      </p>

      <h2>Cabugao Gamay Island</h2>

      <p>
        This island is perhaps one of the most recognizable in Gigantes Island
        because of its widely shared photos in social media. The Cabugao Gamay
        Island is famous not just for its beauty but also for its peculiar,
        elongated shape. From above, one end of the island is covered with thick
        flora while the other end features some rock formation. In between is a
        beautiful white sandbar while emerald green waters surrounding the
        island. The beach is filled with piles of zen stones, that recently
        became an unexpected tourist attraction on Cabugao Gamay Island. Join a
        shared day trip to get the full experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Bantigue Island</h2>

      <p>
        Head to the surreal Bantigue Island and its amazingly long sandbar. How
        the sandbar looks depends on the current, so better check the local
        weather before you go. If you want to camp out on an island, you can do
        it on Bantigue Island; imagine how perfect the sunrise and sunsets would
        be. Apart from swimming and camping, one of the best things to do here
        is to feast on scallops!
      </p>
      <h2>Antonia Beach</h2>
      <p>
        This beach in Iloilo has vast boulders on its shores. If you look a
        little closer, you‚Äôll see the boulders‚Äô erosion lines that make them
        look like sandwiches piled on top of each other. That‚Äôs why the island
        is also called The Sandwich Island, but there‚Äôs more! Antonia Beach is
        often the recommended lunch stopover for the island hopping tours.
      </p>

      <h2>Tinagong Dagat</h2>
      <p>
        It used to be called Isla Bonita, but it was changed to Tinagong Dagat,
        which means ‚Äúhidden beach.‚Äù This secluded beach is dubbed as the Little
        Boracay of Iloilo since Boracay Island is the most famous white-sand
        island beach destination in the Philippines. Tinagong Dagat is a
        secluded beach with fine, powdery, white sand, crystal clear waters, and
        big stones that are perfect for small cliff jumping.
      </p>
      <h2>Tangke Saltwater Lagoon</h2>
      <p>
        This is another social media-famous Iloilo tourist spot. The word tangke
        means tank. The locals call it such because of the gap between two large
        boulders, which form an opening during low tide. You can visit this
        hidden, natural saltwater lagoon and swim in its clear, shallow waters.
        Locals believe that the deep pool is the home of engkantos (mythical
        environmental spirits). Tourists are often told to keep the noise level
        and activities at minimum to not disturb the minds.
      </p>
      <h2>Pawikan Cave</h2>
      <p>
        After all that island-hopping, swimming, and feasting on scallops and
        oysters, do something that‚Äôs more physically challenging: explore the
        Pawikan Cave! No, it‚Äôs not a secret hiding place for the pawikan (sea
        turtles). The cave got its name because of the massive rock formations
        here that look like eggs. From the jump-off point in Barangay Lantanga,
        the trek takes about 1 hour to the cave‚Äôs entrance. From there, you‚Äôre
        greeted with unbelievable rock formations and brightly lit atriums. It‚Äôs
        a bit eerie for some people. Tour guides advise keeping the noise level
        down so you won't disturb the elements or spirits that are said to be
        living there.
      </p>
      <h2>North Gigantes Island Lighthouse</h2>
      <p>
        The original, Spanish-built lighthouse is gone. The one you‚Äôll see here
        is the more modern one that was built by the Japanese. Still, the views
        from the top of the Gigantes Island Lighthouse is one of the best there
        is. Going here is like a trip back in time. There‚Äôs the abandoned, old
        Spanish building and the vines that have taken on the ruins. It‚Äôs
        dramatic and nostalgic at the same time, definitely a must-visit during
        your Gigantes Islands tour.
