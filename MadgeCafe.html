            The fresh coffee is the thing that distinguishes Madge from other coffee shops. The coffee beans come from the north and provinces of Iloilo and Guimaras.

            In comparison with traditional coffee shops, the brew here is produced using a flavor sieve at Madge's, which keeps coffee beans and helps the savors to grow with any additional layer of grain. <br><br>

            Madge CafÃ© is one of the oldest coffee shops in Iloilo. It was founded in 1951 by Vicente De la Cruz. Initially, the shop sold halo-halo. Once Vicente knew realized that demand was seasonal, he chose to focus on coffee that was first and foremost his passion. <br><br>

            Vicente and his wife Magdalena managed the business until they passed it onto their son, Gerardo. Along with his wife Julieta, they managed the cafe until he passed away. The family business was then passed down to Peter De la Cruz, his son. <br><br>

            Customers can choose what kind of coffee they like best. There are choices for strong coffee at a very affordable price with and without milk.<br><br>

            A different process appears to exist for each type, but only Madge's barista knows the secret. The coffee is best served in combination with puto (steamed rice cake).
