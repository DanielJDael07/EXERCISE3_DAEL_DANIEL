            Calle Real is one of Iloiloâ€™s busiest and most iconic streets. Itâ€™s a highly photographed historic building in the city of Iloilo, and youâ€™ve probably seen it in some travel magazines. <br><br>

            Also known as J.M. Basa Street, here youâ€™ll find a lineup of Spanish-era and Commonwealth buildings with some dating back to the 1800s. <br><br>

            People sometimes call it Heritage Street because the province's elite families once inhabited most of the buildings and homes here. It is easily accessible by jeepneys, and the majority of the tours in Iloilo include this stopover. <br><br>

            Many structures are built on one or two levels. On the first level you can find shops, and on the second floor you can find the residences of Iloiloâ€™s elite families. <br><br>

            In 2000, the municipal government adopted the regional Cultural Preservation Ordinance to protect and prevent any harm to the structures. <br><br>

            Now, many buildings have already been repaired and beautified due to the contributions of the local government and private sectors. <br><br>
