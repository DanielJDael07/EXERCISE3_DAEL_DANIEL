            A high-end resort called Sicogon Island made this part of Iloilo famous during the 70s and 80s. Today, the luxurious resort is no longer in operation.

            However, the island is still a popular Iloilo tourist spot because of its forests, mountains, and beaches where the sand has a light yellow or orange tone. <br><br>

            The Barangay Buaya Beach is believed to be the best swimming spot on the entire island. 
            Teeming with nipa huts and tall coconut trees, it's one of the best Iloilo beaches where you can unwind in peace. <br><br>

            If you want to snorkel, head to Tumaguin Island, but if you're going to do some hiking, you can take on the 1-2 hour hike towards the summit of Mount Opao. <br><br>

            Near the central part of the beach are some cottages that are available for tourists who plan to stay overnight. Make sure to try some activities in Sicogon Island to maximize your experience.
