        <p>
            The striking Lizares Mansion in Tabuc Suba, Jaro, has witnessed a series of tragic events, including the torture of Filipinos during World War II. <br><br>

            If you want to see how the noble and wealthy families of Iloilo lived during the colonial times, donâ€™t miss this beautiful but also a sad reminder of the provinceâ€™s past. <br><br>

            Filipino sugar baron Don Emiliano Lizares built the 3-story mansion in 1937 for his wife, Conchita Gamboa. During the war, the Lizares family fled to hide at Pototan, Iloilo. <br><br>

            The Japanese imperial army used the mansion as headquarters and its basement as a torture ground. After the war, the Lizares family moved back, but the once beautiful villa became a living reminder of tragic times. <br><br>

            When the patriarch died, the mansion was transformed into a casino before it was sold to the Dominicans in 1962. After its renovation, the Lizares Mansion now serves as the church of the Angelicum School Iloilo that also stands inside the Lizares compound. <br><br>

            When youâ€™re in Iloilo, you ride a taxicab or a jeepney, which is an accessible mode of public transportation in the Philippines, and see the white mansion along McArthur Drive in Tabuc Suba, Jaro. <br><br>

            Tourists can join tours and see the intricate rooms and details of its rich past. The best time to visit is during the Christmas season when the whole mansion is adorned with holiday lights.
